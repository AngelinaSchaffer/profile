            <p><b>My name is Angelina Schaffer. I am not your typical graphic designer. While creating designs for clients, I'm also a devoted wife and mother of four daughters.<br> Balancing work and family can be a juggling act, but I have found a way to manage it all. I'm currently pursuing my education at North Idaho College, and in my<br> spare time, I dabble in crafting.

                I have always had a passion for design. I've been drawing and creating since I was a child, and over the years, I have honed in my<br> skills and developed a keen eye for detail. My clients appreciate my unique perspective and ability to bring their vision to life.
                
                <br>Despite the demands of motherhood and academic pursuits, I still finds time to pursue my hobbies. Crafting allows me to unwind <br>and tap into my creative side, which helps me recharge and stay focused on my work and studies.
                
                Overall, I am a graphic designer, a loving wife, and a<br> devoted mother of four. I am a woman who wears many hats, but I handle each role with grace and determination </b></p>
